// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-Pawn
// About:
// I decided to make Pawn the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Pawn) as Pawn is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Pawn programming language. It only makes sense to Pawn the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
